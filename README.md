# PurePromise

My promises library. It tries to be as close to the Promises/A+ spec as possible, with one exception:

__A promise callback _must_ return a promise__

This makes it slightly more verbose, but it has some nice properties. I'll explain them here later.

Influenced by [promise.rb][2], the [Promises/A+ spec][3], and browsers' implementations of promises (for the stuff that's not `#then`).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'pure_promise'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install pure_promise

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Design goals
* Limit the public api to as small as possible (then, fulfill, reject, resolve).
  Everything else should just be convenience methods on top of these.
* No introspection of the value that a promise has resolved to - access should be only allowed through then.
  Otherwise it creates problems with what it should return while pending. (Nil is still a value).

## TODO

* Implement the thenable -> PurePromise part of the promise resolution procedure
* Implement `#catch` method
* Catch exceptions and convert them into rejected promises.
* Add usage instructions
* Hide `#value` by using [this nifty trick][1].
* Consider removing the `pending?`, `fulfilled?` and `rejected?` methods; is allowing inspecting a promise's state wrong?
* DRY up specs; they are pretty verbose atm.
* Get 100% mutation coverage
* Release gem
